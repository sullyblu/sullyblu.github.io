<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"></p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">We are a long line
of cat lovers ( I think it was inherited). &nbsp;My
great-grandfather was a country doctor, and he was the first I knew of
in our family who liked cats, had them in the house, and slept with
them.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">I
have always raised just <span style="font-style: italic;">our</span>
cats and thought about having a cattery,
but we were always moving, and&nbsp;just didn't see spending the
money with a growing family. &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Cats are clean, as
opposed to their close pet partners &#8211; dogs. &nbsp;It seems dogs
delight in
rolling in whatever dead, stinky stuff that happens to be lying
around.&nbsp; The
cat breed (Felis catus) share many traits, but all the attitudes are
different. The attitudes are learned from their families. &nbsp;We
love dogs, too, but we can definitely see the difference in owning dogs
as opposed to owning cats (...we don&#8217;t really &#8220;own&#8221; cats, do
we?).&nbsp; Cats&nbsp;are very
clean, intelligent, dignified and easily trained. (Yes, I said
that!)</p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Persians cats have
many more variations and markings&nbsp;than any other
breed. &nbsp;They come in many colors &#8220;to match your dï¿½cor&#8221;.
&nbsp;In the cat
family, the
colors also denote personality traits... from the tortoiseshell
colored, sometimes called &#8220;naughty torties&#8221;, to the black variety,
commonly known as&nbsp;the &#8220;laid-back blacks&#8221;, and of course, the
"talkative blues"!
&nbsp;When
I have a litter of kitties, it is always very exciting to see what
we will have.&nbsp; Every litter can be, as the old saying goes,
"like a box of
chocolates... you never know what
you will get!" &nbsp;Kitties are not carbon copies. &nbsp;They
are all original! &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Our
cattery is home to CFA registered Persians and Himalayans, that come
from champion bloodlines. &nbsp;The kittens are raised in a warm,
loving home,
and a cage-less environment, where they spend their early days learning
the "basics", like feeding, using litter, and using a scratching
post&nbsp;from mom and dad, interacting and socializing with
people,
and of course, playing and "being a kitten" with their brothers and
sisters!</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">All of our Persian cats
have
long beautiful coats, pug faces, and are always posing for a picture to
be taken. </span><span style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">If
you have ever had a Persian before, you know you cannot resist their
sweet gentle nature.&nbsp; I have always
said &#8220;I don&#8217;t sell cats, I sell companions.&#8221;&nbsp;</span></p>
