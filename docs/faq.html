<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">How
do I make a reservation for a kitten?&nbsp;Do
you have a waiting list?</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">If
there is a particular
kitten you are interested in, send me an email
with the Kitten&#8217;s name and your phone number. I will call and we can
make arrangements. &nbsp;If we do not currently have a kitten that
matches what you are looking for, we can put you on our waiting list
for future litters (deposit required).</p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">What
are your prices for kittens? &nbsp;What methods of payments do you
accept?</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">Prices for our
kittens will depend
on the kitten and rarity of color, typically ranging between
$1000-$3000.&nbsp; I accept cash, cashier's checks, and money orders
only, at this time.
&nbsp;When
you fill out the contract, I will need a down payment (typically half
the price of the kitten) to save
your kitty for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;The litter is registered with
CFA.&nbsp;
I have registration papers for all of the kittens in the
litter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Are
all your kittens "fixed" (spayed or neutured) at time of adoption?
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">No. &nbsp;I
sell most of the
kittens as pets, and the prices listed above are for pets. &nbsp;If
you
would like to buy a&nbsp; kitten with CFA breeding rights, please
contact me, and there will
be a fee of $500, in addition to the price of the kitten.</span></p>
<br />
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">Are
all of your kittens up to date on vaccines? &nbsp;What other kinds
of testing have they undergone?</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">They will have
their first shots/worming at eight weeks. I do not let them leave the cattery until after 8 weeks and around 10 weeks, depending on the kitten.
&nbsp;My Tom and Queens come from a catteries that are PKD/DNA negative. PKD is Polycystic Kidney Disease that
is inherited. <br />
</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">How
can I pick up my kitten?
What if I live outside of
the state of Texas?&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">To pick up
your kitten, please make arrangements to drive to me or I will meet you
at the Austin, TX airport.&nbsp; The kittens do not leave me until 12
week old. At this age, they are too small to fly cargo, but can fly
with you in a carrier that fits under the seat. (Check with your
airline for more information.)</p>
<br />
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">How
often do you have (or expect to have) new litters of kittens?</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">I plan to have
only one or two
litters yearly per queen.&nbsp; It is important to me to keep it
low,
so that I may get to know, love
and kiss each baby daily, before they are ready to go to their forever
homes. &nbsp;</span> </p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);">&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;">What
is their life like in the beginning weeks?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-style: italic;">Our kittens are raised indoors
and I
start feeding them special foods as soon as their eyes are opened. I
handle all the kitties at a very early age, so they are quite use to
people. We go for car rides. Also, I do take them outside in my arms
only. About that time, I provide scratching post (their size) and small
pie plates with litter. Mom usually uses the pie plate litter to teach
them. They learn all the indoor cat tricks from mom and the brothers
and sisters.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"></p>
<p style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">So why the name "Sullivan
Blu"?&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-style: italic;">My
daughter has always been a student of the Civil War, better known as
"The War between the North and the South."&nbsp; I would get books
and
videos about the war for us to read and watch together, and
we&nbsp;came across the story&nbsp;of a very brave and eloquent
Union
soldier who was going into the First Battle of Bull Run, just one week
after he wrote a dear and touching letter to his wife, Sarah.&nbsp;
(I
will warn you that if you read it, be prepared with tissues.)
&nbsp;This soldier's name was "Major Sullivan Ballou".</span></p>
<p style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-style: italic;">So, in fitting with our interest
in the civil war and my love of Blue Persians, we named the cattery
Sullivan Blu.</span></p>

Sullivan Ballou, including the letter to his wife Sarah, please visit
